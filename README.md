C Memory handle. Used to traverse, manipulate, and read raw memory structures.

this code is GPLv3 and also AGPL i suppose.

i can't recommend using this for any purpose. don't use this code

like FILE but for memory with extra features. runs on windows and linux.

i made it for my projects. i don't feel like documenting this. there probably bugs. and rats.
